# Battle-snake-final-solution
This is the final code for the battle snake competition during my Artificial Intelligence class

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Replit
- Battlesnake Website

# Project Contributors
- Kendarius James - Coded the flood fill and closed-in functions. These functions allowed the snake to read the game board to see if it had enough space to move in the desired direction on the game board.

# Project Description
The purpose of the project was to utilize the min-max adversarial search algorithm to predict and outlive your opponent on the game board. 
Battlesnake's goal is to manage your snake's hunger and body size to outlive, attack, and compete with other snakes that is currently on the board. For the player to control the snake, they need to write code for their chosen programming language to create functions and algorithms to safely outlive other snakes in the game. At the end of the project, the desired snake was to go against the other team's snake in a 3-round tournament to see who had the best snake in the competition. This project was a team based competition.
